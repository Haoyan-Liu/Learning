# Tree Traversal & Binary Tree Properties

## Tree Traversal Methods

- **Pre-order Traversal** (Root → Left → Right)
- **In-order Traversal** (Left → Root → Right)
- **Post-order Traversal** (Left → Right → Root)

## Balanced Binary Tree

A binary tree in which the height difference between the left and right subtrees of every node is at most 1.

## Complete Binary Tree

A binary tree in which all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.

A Complete Binary Tree (CBT) is always a Balanced Binary Tree.

## Binary Search Tree (BST)

- **Left Subtree Rule**: The left child must contain a value less than its parent node.
- **Right Subtree Rule**: The right child must contain a value greater than its parent node.
- **No Duplicates (Typically)**: BSTs generally do not allow duplicate values.
